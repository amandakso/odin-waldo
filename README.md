# Where's Waldo(A Photo Tagging App)

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

Inspired by the classic game, Where's Waldo, players try to catch pokemon in the shortest amount of time. A leaderboard shows the top 25 fastest times. The main objective for this assignment of The Odin Project was to gain experience and familiarity with using React and Firebase.
